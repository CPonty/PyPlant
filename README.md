PyPlant
=======

Python program for modelling vegetation growth as an inheritance-based tree data structure, including 3D rendering using the Visual 5 libray.

Unfortunately, I had to abandon the project just after I finished the data structures and a rendering demo. I may finish it one day using a different library - the model rendering performance in Python Visual is quite poor.

Extension project for UQ's *CSSE1001 - Introduction to Software Engineering* course (2010)
